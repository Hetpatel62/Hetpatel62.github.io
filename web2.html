      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Winnipeg, where I am building a solid foundation in programming, data structures, and web development. My passion lies in creating responsive and efficient web applications that not only meet user needs but also provide an engaging user experience.</p>
      <p>With hands-on experience in languages such as Python, Java, and C++, I have developed a keen understanding of object-oriented programming and algorithm design. I have successfully completed several projects that showcase my ability to translate complex problems into functional solutions, leveraging frameworks like React and Angular to deliver user-friendly interfaces.</p>
      <p>My education in Applied Computer Science is complemented by a minor in Mathematics, which has honed my analytical skills and problem-solving capabilities. I have a strong grasp of database management, advanced SQL techniques, and cloud computing platforms, which enables me to effectively manage data and optimize application performance.</p>
      <p>I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to team efforts and learn from others. I am always eager to take on new challenges, whether through internships, projects, or coding competitions, as I believe these experiences are essential for professional growth.</p>
      <p>As I continue my academic journey, I am excited to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and make meaningful contributions to innovative projects. I am looking forward to opportunities that allow me to leverage my technical expertise while further developing my skills in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.</p>
